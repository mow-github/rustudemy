/*
    Write a Rust program that takes daily temperature inputs for a week and calculates the average temperature for that week.      

    The program should take daily temperature inputs for each day of the week (e.g., Monday to Sunday).
    The temperatures can be integers or floating-point numbers.    

    The program should calculate and print the average temperature for the week.

    - Efficient use of loops and arrays to handle daily temperature inputs.
    - Proper handling of user input and error cases.
